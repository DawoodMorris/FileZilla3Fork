What is a prefix?
=================

Long story short: The directory you pass to the --prefix parameter of configure


Switching prefixes
=================

. prefix.sh ~/prefix

Sourcing prefix.sh changes the prefix to the passed directory.

If passing multiple directories, prefixes are chained together, with earlier one taking precedence.

Passing no arguments resets the prefix.


The profile script
==================

prefix.sh sources a file named profile from the prefix directory, where you can set any number
of additional environment variables.
The most commonly set variable this way is the CONFIGURE_ARGS variable, see below.


Running configure
=================

configure.sh calls configure, with the contents of CONFIGURE_ARGS environment variable expanded as additional arguments to configure

Note that configure.sh does not pass --prefix to configure


Useful aliases
==============

Assuming prefix scripts are located in ~/prefix_scripts, add the following two lines to ~/.bashrc

alias prefix=". ~/prefix_scripts/prefix.sh"
alias conf="~/prefix_scripts/configure.sh"
